- 👋 Hi, I’m @animesh08bec (Animesh Kumar Pal)
- 👀 I’m interested in all kinds of programming language, automation, AI & ML, Programs Related to Advanced Structural Analysis, Mathematics (Applied and Pure).
- I have a Bachelors Degree in Civil Engineering (I.I.E.S.T. Shibpur) and Masters degree in Structural Engineering(I.I.T. Kharagpur). I have huge interest in solving 
- P.D.E. by Methods like F.E.M., Meshfree Methods, SBFEM, BEM and other Approximate Methods. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning various things related to Computer Science, Mathematics.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on programs related to Structural Mechanics. However I have interests in various other fields. But mostly my interest is in finding and applying Approximate Methods
- to solve P.D.E. as applicable in any branch of Physics.
